# jlox

A Java reimplementation of the Lox programming language, with some modifications to the core grammar and tokenizer listed below.

## Design choices

### Philosophy

- Code as you go - go back and abstract if it's needed.
- Some duplication is acceptable - I don't want to strictly follow DRY if it only means to reduce some duplication.

### Supporting `this`

### Supporting `super`
